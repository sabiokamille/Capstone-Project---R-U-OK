Being a member of a group allows you to interact with peers who are not part of your everyday life. These interactions, along with those of the therapist, can give you useful feedback that you may not get from friends or family. Group is also a safe environment where you can safely try out different ways of interacting with others, such as initiating conversations or improving your listening skills.The specific groups available each semester vary in theme and time commitment, but in recent semesters we have offered groups for students struggling with anxiety (including social anxiety), depression, emotional regulation, eating issues, grief and loss, sexual identity, and general interpersonal issues for both undergraduate and graduate students.</string>

It also creates an opportunity for students to identify if they would be interested in therapy, as many people are skeptical due to the stigma surrounding mental health.Lets Talk sessions are available in person or by phone. Walk-ins are welcome, however, appointments are highly recommended. Please note that appointments will be prioritized before walk-ins.</string>
